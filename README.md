# Bayesian Networks and Reinforcement Learning - AI

## Introduction

The **Bayesian Networks and Reinforcement Learning** project is an exploration of uncertainty in the realm of Artificial Intelligence. This project delves into algorithms, methodologies, and techniques associated with Bayesian Networks and Reinforcement Learning.

## Project Overview

The project encompasses two primary components: Computing Exact Inference in Bayesian Networks (BN) and implementing a Finite Markov Decision Process (FiniteMDP) agent using Reinforcement Learning techniques.

### Exact Inference in Bayesian Networks

This section of the project involves the study and implementation of algorithms related to probabilistic modeling and inference using Bayesian Networks. The focus is on understanding the concepts of conditional probabilities, joint probabilities, and the relationship between variables in acyclic Bayesian Networks.

### Reinforcement Learning and FiniteMDP

In this segment, the project explores the realm of Reinforcement Learning through the development of a FiniteMDP agent. Concepts such as Markov Decision Processes, reward structures, and optimal decision-making are central to this component. The implementation showcases the agent's ability to learn and adapt its actions in an environment to maximize long-term cumulative rewards.

### Technology Stack

- Python 3.6.2 along with algorithms and methods related to Bayesian Networks and Reinforcement Learning are employed in this implementation.
